#### In this lab, I am going to implement a hybrid DNS system between AWS and a simulated on-premises environment.

## Provision and Verify
* First I used the Cloudformation template provided by learn.cantrill.io to automate the building of some necessary resources.

* The template created 5 instances, and I tested them by connecting into them with session manager and tried pining app.corp.animals4life.org, which is a DNS domain also created by the template.

* Currently, nothing is configured so the instance cannot ping from it.

## Connectivity
* In this part, I am going to establish the hybrid network connectivity using VPC peering.
* For this, I navigated to the VPC console and created a peering connection with the AWS VPC as the requester VPc and the On-Prem VPc as the accepter VPC.

* Then I edited the route table for both AWS and On-prem so that both route tables has the IP CIDR range of each.

* To test the connectivity, I copied the IP address of one of the instance hosted on the on-premises server and connected to an instance hosted on AWS and tried pinging from it.

* I can see that the instance can ping from the IP address but it still doesnâ€™t have DNS integration.

## Inbound R53 Endpoint
* In this part, I am going to create the inbound endpoint for traffic coming into AWS from the on-premises server.
* For this, I first navigated to the R53 console and created an inbound endpoint.

* Then I connected to an on-premises instance and navigated to the /etc/named.conf file and edited the zone part to this:
````
zone "aws.animals4life.org" {   type forward; 
  forward only;
  forwarders { INBOUND_ENDPOINT_IP1; INBOUND_ENDPOINT_IP2; }; 
};
````

* Now I can do a name server look up from the session manager.

* Then I did the same thing for the instance hosted on another availability zone.
* Then I navigated to the application instance of the on-premise server and opened: /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
* I edited it by adding DNS= the private IP addresses of the on-premise DNS instances.

* Then I rebooted and reconnected into the EC2 instance and tried pinging from the DNS domain.

* The pinging is working successfully.

## Outbound R53 Endpoint
* In this part I am going to create an outbound endpoint for traffic going out of AWS.
* I navigated to the R53 console and created a new outbound endpoint
![unnamed (28)](https://github.com/yehjuneheo/AWS_HOL/assets/51499085/aabc1f3d-cadf-4cff-9416-d92a65dbd1ee)

* Then I created a new rule for the outbound endpoint that targets the private IP addresses of the on-premise DNS instances.

* Now I can see that I can ping app.corp.animals4life from my AWS instance.

### What I Learned
* I need to create both an inbound and outbound endpoint to successfully configure a working VPC peering.
* I need to use private IP addresses when trying to connect AWS and on-premises instances for a secure VPC peering connection.
