#### This section covers about using Route53 and Failover Routing

## Using R53 and Failover Routing
* First I used the CloudFormation template provided by learn.cantrill.io to automate building the required resources.

* If I go into the public IP address of the created EC2 instance, I can see that the website is working:

* Then I allocated an elastic IP address and associated it with the EC2 instance:

* Then I created a new bucket name www.yehjuneheotraining.com, and uploaded the index.html and minimal.jpg that will be used for static hosting.

* Then I enabled static hosting for the bucket and set the index document and error document both as index.html.
* I also edited the bucket policy to allow public reading.

* To configure failover routing, I first created a health check from Route53.

* Then I changed the default request interval of standard (30 seconds) to fast (10 seconds) and created the health check.

* Then I went to the R53 console and created a new record with a failover routing policy and two failover records.

* The records were successfully created:

* Then I stopped the EC2 instance waited a few minutes until the health check moves to an unhealthy state.

* Now if I go to www.yehjuneheotraining.com, I can see the failover page:

* Then I created a private hosted zone in my default VPC, and this allows me to use a domain name that I donâ€™t even own.

* Then I created a simple record:

* Now if I connect to the EC2 instance and try pinging from www.privatewebsite.com, I can see it works:
